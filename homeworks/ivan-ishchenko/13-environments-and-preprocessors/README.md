# Homework #13

## Environments and preprocessors

The task of this homework is to modify the 04-css task to use module bundler and preprocessors.
For module bundler I used webpack. Also styles were rewritten into scss.

### Scripts

- **npm run dev** - builds for development
- **npm run build** - builds for production
- **npm start** - starts development server
